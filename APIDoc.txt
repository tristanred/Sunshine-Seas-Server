== Server model ==
The server model is a client-server-replication model. The backend server is not dealing with gamelogic directly
and the game client acts as a source of server information. A client can connect to a backend server to create a game
session. Each other client can connect to the backend server and join the game session.

Once in a game session, the initial client will send information to the backend and the other clients can
request that information.

This is similar to the way Unreal Engine manages their servers. Since the backend does not deal with game logic
it does not need to share any technologies with the game client or have to reimplement the game logic classes. This
also isolates the client that acts as a server by avoiding the need to receive the connections of the other players.
That does mean that you need to reserve one client to act as a server but leaves it open to make it a "headless" client
or be a playing client that just happens to also maintain the "master state" of the game.

Negative points include the fact that there is some duplication of functionality on the server since it cannot share
code with the client. That there needs to have a separate "server backend" + "client server" running in paralel with 
each other.
