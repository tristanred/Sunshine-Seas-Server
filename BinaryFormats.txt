Reminder document about the wire formats of the server messages.

The server is using message structures defined in the src/commands directory.
These structure define the logical format of the messages and not necessarily
how these messages are passed between the clients and the server. This is mostly
due to the bunary format being serially encoded data and not a json or such
format being passed around and parsed/jsonifined.

When a message structure becomes too complex, some documentation will provide
details on how the structure is serialised on the wire but most of the time
the only consideration is for arrays. A structure keeps the properties in the
same order in binary that in the logical format. We do not keep `count` property
next to a vector in the logical format because a Vec already contains such
information. Instead we assume that in the wire format each array is prepended
by a u32 containing the size of the following array.
